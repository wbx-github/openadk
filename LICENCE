This licence file covers all of the OpenADK meta distribution
source code (including Makefiles and documentation).

Binary firmware images are composed of the meta distribution
OpenADK and downloaded distfiles from third party sources,
which may be covered by various differing licence terms, but
since the firmware image only aggregates differently licenced
packages on the same medium we believe it is redistributable
as long as the licences of the different packages are honoured.


OpenADK itself is developed by Waldemar Brodkorb and covered
by the GNU General Public License, Version 2 or later, as shown
in the file COPYING in this directory. Individual files may be
covered by the LGPL or BSD-style licences instead. OpenADK also
contains tools that are possibly covered by non-GPL-compatible,
but OSD/DFSG-compliant, licences. 

OpenADK is based upon several other projects which are listed
below, in no particular order. If you think you should be listed 
here but I have forgotten you, please forgive and drop
me an email.

• The FreeWRT Project
• The OpenWrt Project
• The Buildroot Project
• The Aboriginal Linux Project
• The MirOS Project and contributors
